- Bluetooth Connectivity: The app establishes a robust Bluetooth connection with the EV3 robot, ensuring reliable communication and control.

- The big motor can be directed in four directions (forward, backward, left, and right). Additionally, the medium motor can be controlled separately.

- Musical Keyboard Piano: One of the fragments features a keyboard piano functionality. You can play notes and create melodies right from your Android device. This feature showcases the app's ability to send commands to the EV3 robot's speaker, creating an engaging audio-visual experience.

- Touch Sensor Integration: When the touch sensor is triggered, the app receives real-time feedback, enabling robot to reuturn to its starting spot.
